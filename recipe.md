Do not take it because it won't be that soft so wait for 10-15 minutes. Now when the pasta is boiling chop the vegetables. Now to check whether the pasta is cooked take one pasta with a fork and bite. If its a little firm to bite then it's cooked otherwise it needs more cooking but mostly this won't happen.
